## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge helped me pratice flexbox! 

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. 
Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I'm proud of this:

```css
.container {
    height: 700px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

.centre {
    background-color: white;
    width: 300px;
    border-radius: 5%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue to use flexbox, but next time I want to see if I can use grids with it too!
